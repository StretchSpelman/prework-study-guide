# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description
My motivation for creating this project is because I want to be able to better the life my wife and I have, and I realized it can truly happen with this course.
I built this project because I needed my notes to be easily accessable and also to use this as a learning experience.
This project solves the problem of not having an organized webpage to hold and contain the notes on this prework that I completed before class started.
I learned a ton in this prework, but I think one of the main things that I learned is that no matter what everything is a learning experience and to not get discouraged even though it will happen at times and to always use this as a learning experience and try to solve things on your own.

## Usage
So the way this webpage can be used is there are 4 different topics on the webpage, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git now we can keep notes organized and keep them grouped with the correct topic. This also makes it a lot easier to choose which topic we want to study first since we have taken the time to organize these topics neatly with the notes included.
